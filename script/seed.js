    price: 120,
    description: `LIGHTNING FAST: Optic Switch technology gives you a true competitive edge with optical detection for keys that react at light speed. The continuous optical beam delivers zero-latency, with a 0.2ms response time versus the 30ms of mechanical. Each key is full NKRO and engineered with a calculated shallow stroke. This ensures each keypress can register simultaneously regardless of how many keys are pressed at a time, while also increasing active return rate and decreasing finger fatigue.
                  BATTLE TESTED DURABILITY: The LK Libra is manufactured with weapons-grade anodized aluminum, providing a lightweight frame that is smudge- and fingerprint-resistant. This keyboard has been engineered to withstand over 100 million keystrokes per switch, with a stabilizing bar that reinforces every key for tighter control and a premium, uniform key feel. With features that resist oxidation, water damage, spills, and intense gaming, you and your gear will be able to outlast the competition!
                  WATER RESISTANT & DIGITAL SENSORS: Engineered with nanocoating, a water-resistant barrier, and strategic drainage holes, this keyboard is well designed to ensure you're never out of the fight when accidents happen. The optical sensors are completely digital, freeing them from mechanical failures caused by metal friction, liquid spills, oxidization, and more. These sensors ensure extreme precision actuation and true 1:1 raw input.
                  RGB BACKLIGHTING EFFECTS: Switch between 3 default RGB LED backlighting animations or download our exclusive software for 16.8 million customizable color options and schemes. Change the color and effect to match battle intensity during game play or to represent your squad, guild, or clan. Our intuitive design incorporates easily adjustable dimming or brightening options so it won't distract from your gaming experience.
                  ERGONOMIC DESIGN: This gaming keyboard has a detachable ergonomic wrist rest and additional keys that are comfortably within reach for crucial bindings and macros. The design is ideal for strenuous gaming sessions as it helps to reduce long-term shoulder strain by allowing more neutral mouse and keyboard positioning. The wrist rest comes with two swappable wrist rest faceplates in black and red, and has been engineered to deliver total comfort and quick, convenient stowing and portability.`,
